# Problem
  We have given an array with all elements occuring even times except one element which is occurring odd time.
  We have to find and print that element.
  
## Approach 1:
  Check the frequency of every element and if count is odd then print that element.
  [Method 1]()

## Approach 2:
  Use of XOR operator as we know that,
    a^a = 0;
    a^0 = a;
    [Method 2]()
